### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am David
**Hello this is my personal GitHub readme, I am a first year CS major @UC, Irvine.**

I want to be a computer scientist. Some fun fact about me is that this is the first time I start to use GitHub.  
My pronounce is He/His/Him. I am a beginner, I really want to learn more about coding. I wish to get an internship soon, hopefully. I am currently learning about discrete math for Computer Science, boolean algebra, linear algebra, and Intermediate Programming. I do Python and Java, and a little HTML.
