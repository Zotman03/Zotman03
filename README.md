### Hello I am David Ning (He/Him) ðŸ‘‹
**Hello this is my personal GitHub readme, I am a Third year Computer Science major @UC, Irvine.**

My interests are Artificial intelligence / Machine Learning / Virtual Reality.
I want to study more in the field of intelligence system. I wonder how AI can be applied to other fields of computer science

I am currently working on three projects (Virtual Reality and Education, Large Language Model and Judicial Fariness, and Domain Name System)
